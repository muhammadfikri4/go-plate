# Go Fiber Boilerplate

Go Fiber Boilerplate is a starter template for building simple REST APIs using Go Fiber, GORM, and PostgreSQL. This project provides a ready-to-use setup with features like CRUD operations, pagination, and validation, following the clean architecture principles.

## Technologies Used

- **Golang**: The programming language used for this project.
- **Fiber**: An Express-inspired web framework for Golang.
- **GORM**: The ORM library for Golang.
- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database used for storing data.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Predefined template for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Pagination**: Easy-to-use pagination for API responses.
- **Validation**: Input validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Clean Architecture**: Organized project structure following clean architecture principles.
